# Spotify Listener Profile Dashboard
It's a constant struggle to find new music. Spotify’s recommendation system is incredibly helpful, but I found that it rarely recommends anything other than similar artists and genres. My question was, what might be an alternative way to conceptualize a user’s listening habits so that a recommendation system would not fail to find a great recommendation because it’s genre, release decade, etc. is incongruent with the rest of the user’s library? The visualization I developed allows users to see how their musical taste developed over time according to some truly unique metrics that Spotify collects within their music library. These metrics demonstrate what is consistent across the artists that a given user listens to, not considering obvious signifiers like genre. This serves as an initial conceptualization of an alternative method of profiling user's musical taste - sort of a Myers-Briggs, but for music taste instead of personality.
